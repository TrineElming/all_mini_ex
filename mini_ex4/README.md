This projects consists of an image of a hand, that "pretends" to be reading your palm, and a button that reveals what your palm says about your personality. In regards to data capture, the sketch "pretends" to capture the lines of the user's plam, such as "the life line", "the heart line", and "the head line", when putting a hand on the screen. In reality, the hand is an uploaded picture, and the only interaction in the sketch comes from pressing the button that says "GO" with a mouse. 
It took me a long time to figure out what my project would be, and although I think this palm-reading-project that I ended up creating was fun to make, I wish that I had come up with a more creative and critical idea for this weeks mini exercise. 
After creating the project, I also realized that the activity and data capture of the palm-reading could have been more convincing if there was a kind of "throbber" that displayed that your palm was being read. All in all, I wish my sketch was more critical in its design, but I also like the fun that is brought to the sketch.

The fact that I could not come up with a critical idea to this weeks mini excersize, perhaps shows that it is not something that I think about a lot. But in the process of creating this project and witnessing many critical projects by my peers, I really got to think about how much the internet "knows" about me as a person and I wish that I also had the abilities to portray this issue in my project.
