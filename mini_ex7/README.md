This week, Ida Br√§uner Madsen and I worked together in creating this project. The projects is based on two poems by the danish poet Tove Ditlevsen, called "Blinkende Lygter" ("flashing lights") and "Pigesind" ("a girl's mind"). The background is a picture of Tove Ditlevsen, and the photo should adapt to window-width and window-height. The poems are displayed in their original state at first on each side of the page, but when you press your mouse anywhere on the screen, every second line in both poems, switch places with the other poem. And although you might think this action would result in the poems not making any sense, every second line match almost perfectly with the sentences in the other poem.

The overall perspective in the text "Vocable Code" by Cox & Mclean mostly revolves around speech and how coding as a practice can be seen as a translation tool between speech in human terms and how a computer interpret this. In our program, we focused solely on the literary aspect of coding, and how to use code to implement literature in a program. As a result, the text "Vocable Code" seem a bit inrelevant, if you look at the text's many perspectives on speech in coding, and not writing.
On the other hand, the text also draws attention to programming as a language in itself and as a supplement to natural language, and this is displayed in our project. The programming language works as a supplement in how the poems' every other lines switch places by clicking. This act is executed by a user, but it is the computer that is executing the act of the switching. This creates a programming language, in the way the poems still makes sense, although the lines are switched.
