This week, Ida Br√§uner Madsen and I worked together in creating this project. The projects is based on two poems by the danish poet Tove Ditlevsen, called "Blinkende Lygter" ("flashing lights") and "Pigesind" ("a girl's mind"). The background is a picture of Tove Ditlevsen, and the photo should adapt to window-width and window-height. The poems are displayed in their original state at first on each side of the page, but when you press your mouse anywhere on the screen, every second line in both poems, switch places with the other poem. And although you might think this action would result in the poems not making any sense, every second line match almost perfectly with the sentences in the other poem.


Each of you in the group analyze your own e-lit work by using the text'Vocable Code': what is the aesthetic aspects of your program in particular to the relationship between code and language?
