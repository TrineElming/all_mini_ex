In this procject, I wanted to use shapes as I did in my first program, but I wanted there to be more interaction with the shapes, than in the previous project. I then thought of the idea that the shapes should be "pressable", and this would become the interaction. I also wanted to use images in my project and saw the *loadImage()* approach as a way to make images appear. 
In relation to this, I wanted the images to match the shapes, so for example when you press the yellow ecllipse, the moon in the artwork by Monet matches the ellipse, and after you press the shape again, the image disappers. This was very diffuclt to code for me, because I had to use the *tint()*-approach to make the images disappear, and I found it frustrating that I could not use a simple-sounding code like *hide()*, as that would make more sense to me. Luckily, the instructors helped me understand why *hide()* would not work, and that *tint()* was the best approach to use. Eventually the project worked, but even though it sounded as a simple idea to me before I started my project, I found it to be very difficult to implement as codes. Fortunanely, the intructors helped me understand the different variables I had to use for the project, and in the process of making the project, I got a much better understanding of the possible extent to a simple idea.

In her text "Fun and Software" Olga Goriunova, among other definitions, describes fun as following: *"Fun is a processual unfolding found in movement..."* (Goriunova 2014, p. 10) I believe this is portrayed in my project, as the interactions with the different shapes and the images appearing and disappearing as results of the interactions. I also believe that the element of surprise I wanted to portray in my project can be seen as a form of fun. The user does not know that there is artwork hidden in the interaction with the shapes, and I find this discovering entertainting, as the user continuously can play with the interaction with the different shapes and artworks.
