My program is fairly simple this week, and with minimal interaction. The object is an ice cream cone, where you by clicking your mouse, adds scoops to the cone, resulting in an ice cream cone with three different scoops. It is probably fair to say, that this is not a game in the traditional sense, but I wanted to create an object that the user could interact with, without trying to create something too ambitious. And although the scoops appear in a bit of a strange order, I think the object-oriented programming comes through in my project.

The ice cream cone is a object in itself, but the scoops are the objects that have attributes and methods. The attributes of the scoops are their form, size, position and colors and the method is the interaction with a click of a mouse that results in the scoops appearing in the ice cream cone, as a result of the *mouseClicked*- and *show*-functions.

Object-oriented programming is about breaking software into objects that consists of a class, attributes and methods. The class of an object is described as the DNA of an object, as the class can be seen as the description of attributes. These attributes belongs to the object, and are the different characteristics an object can consist of. The methods belonging to an object is the different actions that the object is programmed to execute.

Extend/connect your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted and encapsulated?
