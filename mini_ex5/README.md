My program is fairly simple this week, and with minimal interaction. The object is an ice cream cone, where you by clicking your mouse, adds scoops to the cone, resulting in an ice cream cone with three different scoops. It is probably fair to say, that this is not a game in the traditional sense, but I wanted to create an object that the user could interact with, without trying to create something too ambitious. And although the scoops appear in a bit of a strange order, I think the object-oriented programming comes through in my project.

The ice cream cone is a object in itself, but the scoops are the objects that have attributes and methods. The attributes of the scoops are their form, size, position and colors and the method is the interaction with a click of a mouse that results in the scoops appearing in the ice cream cone, as a result of the *mouseClicked*- and *show*-functions.

Object-oriented programming is about breaking software into objects that consists of a class, attributes and methods. The class of an object is described as the DNA of an object, as the class can be seen as the description of attributes. These attributes belongs to the object, and are the different characteristics an object can consist of. The methods belonging to an object is the different actions that the object is programmed to execute.

As previously stated, my project this week is simple and therefore a bit difficult do connect to a wider digital culture context, because of its simplicity. The program itself is without any critical viewpoints, but more about object-oriented programming in practice, by using a *class* syntax, and the methods and attributes belonging to the objects of the scoops.
In his text, Lee describes abstractions as "... capturing and focusing on the important details, while leaving out those that are less important." If you look at an example, such as Apple's iPhone, abstractions and encapsulations can be seen in the settings of the iPhone, where you as the user of an iPhone, can control the different settings. For example, the simple ones such as the ringtone, background and text-size and the more advanced settings such as touch ID and Apple Pay â€“ but there will always be, and not only in iPhones, a number of other settings that only the programmers of the iPhone will have access to. I believe this is an example of abstraction as many users would probably not benefit from being able to control all kinds of technical settings of an iPhone, so it is in the hands of the programmers of the phone, to decide what the users can and can not control.
