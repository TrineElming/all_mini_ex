This week, I was a bit frustrated by the assignment, as I did not think that I had the abilities to create a generative program from scratch. I had plenty of ideas, but I was not able to execute them â€“ because of this, I choose to look at the examples from the p5.js website, "Double Random" by Ira Greenberg, and use that code for inspiration. 
In the project I have made from the example I used the *for*-function, in the appearances of the stars on the sky, and the *random*-syntax to make the stars appear at different positions. The example I used was initially a coherent line of dots, but I wanted the dots to spread out more, and move slower. This led to some altering of the numbers, and I also added a *frameRate*-syntax to make the dots, aka. starts change at a slower range. These different actions shows the rules of my program. The displaying of a *point*, the size of the points and the position of the points. 
Over time, my project does not change in any other way than the rearranging of the star-dots, and this has me a bit confused on its generativity, but I think my project is successfull in its unpredictability and autonomous operating.

In my preperation for this week's project, I researched a lot of different generative programs where many programs had different things in common. The use of basic shapes to generate artworks is consistent in many of the programs I found, and this was also my inspiration of the project I ended up making, based on the example by Ira Greenberg. As previously stated, I am not sure just how generative my project is, as the stars in the program creates a "starry night sky" in loops and not a final artwork, but I can see some of the other characteristics of generative art displayed in my project. Besides its unpredictability and autonomous operating, my program launches a kind of process, that develops over time, not changing completely, but through motion.
