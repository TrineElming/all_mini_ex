What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?
In my project I based my throbber-design on Winnies created function, *drawThrobber*. This helped me understand how to make a throbber, and I ended making one that is similar to Winnies, but with a few changes. I wanted to add more color to the throbber, as I believe that many throbbers are very simple in their designs, using grey and black colors. This resulted in a throbber that is similar to a rainbow, using, red, orange, yellow, green and blue colors. The different colors are displayed in six ellipsies in the different colors, looking similar to a rainbow, but still in a throbber-looking design. 

In general, it seems that throbbers frustrate people, because they don't like the waiting, and that is what a throbber symbolizes. In the text "Fidget Spinners" by Jason Farman, he mentions that throbbers, and waiting icons in general, are what makes us wait longer, than if there were no icon â€“ and progress bars are even better than throbbers at making us wait for something, because you can see the progress of the result that is loading. But with my project, I wanted the throbber to be different, as I think many throbbers are simple in their design as before mentioned, with limited use of colors. I wanted to make somthing that is not boring to look at, even though it resembles the standard throbber design.
