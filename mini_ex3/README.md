What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?
In my project I based my throbber-design on Winnies created function, *drawThrobber*. This helped me understand how to make a throbber, and I ended making one that is similar to Winnies, but with a few changes. I wanted to add more color to the throbber, as I believe that many throbbers are very simple in their designs, using grey and black colors. This resulted in a throbber that is similar to a rainbow, using, red, orange, yellow, green and blue colors. The different colors are displayed in six ellipsies in the different colors, looking similar to a rainbow, but still in a throbber-looking design. 

Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture e.g streaming video on YouTube or loading latest feeds on Facebook or waiting a ticket transaction, what do you think a throbber tells us, and/or hides, about? How might we think about this remarkable throbber icon differently?
