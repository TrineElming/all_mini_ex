*Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code.*
Before attending my 2nd semester of Digital Design, I had no experience with programming, and especially not with p5.js. But in spite of that I really enjoyed my first independent coding process in producing the first mini exercise. The p5.js library proved to be very palpable even though it was my first time using it, and I enjoyed using all the different references listed on the o5.js website.    


*How your coding process is different or similar to reading and writing text?*


*What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?*
