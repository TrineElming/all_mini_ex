*Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code.*

Before attending my 2nd semester of Digital Design, I had no experience with programming, and especially not with p5.js. In spite of that I really enjoyed my first independent coding process in producing the first mini exercise. The p5.js library proved to be very palpable even though it was my first time using it, and I enjoyed using all the different references listed on the p5.js website. I copied the different references, for example in creating shapes in the form of rectangles, that I modified in size, colours and strokes. In addition to this I wanted to have one of the rectangles move around with the use of my mouse, and thereby searched for the reference for this. The original reference called *pmouseX* contains a function that leaves a trail from the mouse, but I wanted the trail to show more that a line, so I changed it to a rectangle.
This modification underlines what I liked aout my first coding experience; to modify the references to my liking, and thereby watching the outcome of those changes. In addition to these outcomes, I enjoyed the function of uploading my mini exercise to my server, and thereby watching the outcome of the different coding as it developed with references and modification of these.

*How your coding process is different or similar to reading and writing text?*



*What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?*
