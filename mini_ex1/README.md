Before attending my 2nd semester of Digital Design, I had no experience with programming, and especially not with p5.js. In spite of that I really enjoyed my first independent coding process in producing the first mini exercise. The p5.js library proved to be very palpable even though it was my first time using it, and I enjoyed using all the different references listed on the p5.js website. I copied the different references, for example in creating shapes in the form of rectangles, that I modified in size, colours and strokes. In addition to this I wanted to have one of the rectangles move around with the use of my mouse, and thereby searched for the reference for this. The original reference called *pmouseX* contains a function that leaves a trail from the mouse, but I wanted the trail to show more that a line, so I changed it to a rectangle.
This modification underlines what I liked aout my first coding experience; to modify the references to my liking, and thereby watching the outcome of those changes. In addition to these outcomes, I enjoyed the function of uploading my mini exercise to my server, and thereby watching the outcome of the different coding as it developed with references and modification of these.
On the other hand, my first coding process also proved to be a bit frustrating being my first time trying it. Although the references were easy to copy and use in the mini exercise, it could easily not be working as I thought it would, and that required some reconsidering and remodifying of the coding. Though this was frustrating, the whole process of reading the references, using them, modifying them and watching it work really woke my interest for coding.

When you are reading and writing texts you imagine what you are reading and writing instead of watching results of it and this differ from a coding process. A coding process contains reading and writing as well, but what you are writing has an outcome that you do not have to imagine, you can instead watch how it works.

I look forward to learning more about coding practice, as I think that I am not fully aware of the extent of the world of coding. In this mini exercise, I made a very simple project, but I think as we move forward in this semester, I will be able to code on a more advanced level.
