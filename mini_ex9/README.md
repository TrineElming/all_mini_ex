I found it rather difficult to create a flowchart for my project, as I am not sure what a flowchart of a program entails. I choose the program from the assigment from last week, mini exercise 8, that focuses on an API from the website openweathermap.org. The difficulty in creating a flowchart in relation to the API-program was the overall structure of the flowchart, and what was relevant to display in the flowchart and what was not. In spite of the difficulty, I think the flowchart ended up displaying what the program is about overall, in a way that hopefully is understandable.

#### "Pussy Grabs Back"

We want to create a game that focuses on the #metoo movement. Our plan is to create a game where the player is a Pussycat that is trying to defeat all the misogynist and sexist men. The men are going to be objects that are meant to portray some of the famous men that are known for having sexist opinions or in other ways have offended women. The idea is that the pussy grabs back by eating the men in the game. The men-objects are falling down from the top line of the canvas, and as the game continues and the Pussycat eats the men, the speed of the men falling from the topline increases, so it will become more challenging for the pussycat to eat the men. If the pussycat misses on, the game is over. The reason we haven’t created it with more than one life, is to emphasize how important it is to stay woke and let no sexist go free. 
We have also chosen to create an end on the game, so when the pussycat has eaten all of the sexists she has won the game.

#### "Stay Woke"

We want to create a program that illustrates the growing level of pollution. We want to show this by getting data from an API, so when the level of pollution increases, an image of a so called “garbage-island” increases in size as well. Besides from this we want to bring in data through a different API (such as New York Times), to show some relevant news on the topic pollution. We have also discussed the idea of the garbage-island being made up of pictures of pollution or animals dying as a consequence of the pollution. This would perhaps require getting data from yet another API. Through this project we hope to have an affect on the user and make people aware of how important and urgent this issue is. We want to say: Hello world. Wake up, act now!

#### Technical challenges

In the first project “Pussy Grabs Back”, some of the possible technical challenges could be how we would manage to code an increase of speed of the objects (the sexists) in the game, and perhaps also how to code the action of the two objects as in “the pussycat” and “the sexists” and how they react towards each other, when they are in contact. The solution could be to research other games with the same objective and examine the code.

In our second project, we want to use two different API’s; one that collects the headlines of news articles that focuses on pollution and the consequences we see in the world around us; and a second one that contains exact numbers and data regarding the topic of pollution. A technical challenge here will definitely be to, first of all find API’s with this sort of data that we are able to access, and secondly, we might encounter some problems when uploading the program (just like how the security around the weather API we used for mini_ex8 prevented our programs from executing as they should). 
Another technical difficulty will occur when the API-data increases - we have to be very calculated in terms of how much the “garbage island” should grow. This probably requires some experimenting in terms of investigating how much the level of pollution actually grows, and how we can reflect and put emphasis on this in our program.

The two flowcharts above created in the studygruop, "Pussy Grabs Back" and "Stay Woke" are different from the one I created myself in how the code for the two created in my studygroup does come with an existing program, as "Hot as Yoncé" does. 
This resulted in more technical flowcharts, as we thought out the syntax as we created the flowchart, and did not take into consideration what we are able to code at the moment.

For the past weeks' lecture we read the text "What Algorithms Want" by Ed Finn, and in this he writes about algorithms in general and how they are percieved and used. The quote I want to adress is the following: 

*"Algorithms are everywhere. They already dominate the stock market, compose music, drive cars, write news articles, and author long mathematical proofs—and their powers of creative authorship are just beginning to take shape."* (p. 15)

One of subjects of Finn's text is that algorithms are percieved as magic by most people, because it functions as the examples listed above – but I believe that this is a general problem; that most people don't know how any technologies or softwares actually works. An algorithm is no exception in this issue, and this could be because it is something that we can not see, it is not a physical technology that we can touch, it just works inside machines. I think this is a general issue in that it is also the case with many other technologies that we use everday. For example, I don't actually know how my iPhone really works, I just know how to work it, and how to use it. With this, I think we loose a lot of important knowledge, and it is the same regarding algorithms. We should learn more about the technology behind algorithms, and iPhones for example - as this would help people understand technology and software better.
